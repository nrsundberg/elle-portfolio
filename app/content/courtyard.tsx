        One of my favorite projects I've worked on is designing the branding for
        The Courtyard, a coffee shop & bistro located in Nisswa, Minnesota.
        Nisswa is located two hours north of Minneapolis and is known for its
        many clear lakes and cozy cabin resorts, making it a very popular
        tourist destination.

        I also created and now manage The Courtyard's social media accounts. We
        aim to post twice a week, and each post is meant to be informative and
        engaging. I wanted to create a clear brand voice that was free from the
        ever changing social trends. The Courtyard is not silly or scrappy, it
        is curated and editorial.
