        I designed a logo for real estate professional Angela Headlee. She
        wanted to re-position herself as a specialist in luxury lakeshore
        properties in Northern Minnesota. I used gold and navy blue to adhere to
        Sotheby's International Realty guidelines.

        alt={"Angela Headlee final logo"}
      />

        Below are 6 initial ideas I sent to Angela after learning about her
        goals. She was most drawn the the logo that is top left, which we then
        further refined to align with her simple but elegant taste.
